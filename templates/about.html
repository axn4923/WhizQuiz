                        topics in computer architecture. This website concentrates on processor datapaths and control
                        and pipelining. We want to create a learning application in order to strengthen the knowledge
                        of students By providing educational information and offering quizzes that will help sharpen
                        the learned material. Part of learning a new concept is relating to the material and having fun
                        with it. We want to use this idea to make our learning platform as productive and successful for
                        students as possible. We expect users to enjoy our style of quizzes and the way in which we
                        explain certain topics, thus helping students gain a firmer grasp on topics within computer
                        architecture. The quizzes are multiple-choice and prompt whether the answer is correct/incorrect
                        after each question answered. The quizzes also provide feedback as to why the answer is
                        correct/incorrect. </p>
