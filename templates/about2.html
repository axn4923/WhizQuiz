                    <p class = "text">The processor contains two types of components:
                        Data path- set of components in the processor that together execute an instruction.
                        Control- “The brain”, tells the components in the processor what to do (like OS and hardware).</p>

                  <p class = "text">The register file (RF) is a hardware device that has two read ports and one write
                      port (corresponding to the two inputs and one output of the ALU). The RF and the ALU together
                      comprise the two elements required to compute MIPS instructions. The register file contains an
                      array of processor registers. Typically, we can read values from two registers at a time, and are
                      only able to write to one register at a time. We need to tell the register file which registers
                      we want to read from and write to Register banking is the method of using a single name to access
                      multiple different physical registers depending on the operating mode.</p>

                        main memory -> 2-10 cycles for loads. Larger than registers but smaller than main memory.</p>
